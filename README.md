# Neural Networks with PyTorch: Tensors and Datasets

## Overview
Welcome to my hands-on exploration of neural networks using PyTorch! This repository is my journey through the foundational concepts of AI, focusing on tensors, datasets, and linear regression. I’ve organized the content into clear, progressive modules, each with interactive Jupyter notebooks that make learning and experimentation easy.

## Why This Repo Is a Strong Portfolio Piece

- **Practical, Notebook-Centric Learning:** I’ve developed and structured each topic as a Jupyter notebook, allowing anyone (including myself) to interactively run, modify, and explore the code.
- **Clear Progression:** I start with the basics of tensor operations and build up to more advanced topics like gradient descent and mini-batch training, mimicking real-world learning and project workflows.
- **Mastery of PyTorch:** This project demonstrates my ability to work with one of the most popular deep learning frameworks in the industry.
- **Applied Data Science Skills:** I tackle dataset creation, transformation, and model training—all essential skills for AI and data science.
- **Portfolio-Ready Artifacts:** Each notebook stands alone as a demonstration of my technical and analytical skills.

## Getting Started

If you want to dive in and explore these notebooks yourself:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/usafhulk/Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch-Tensor-and-Datasets.git
cd Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch-Tensor-and-Datasets
```

### Set up your environment:
I recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` isn’t included, you can install the basics:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib jupyter
```

### Run the notebooks:
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any notebook you want from your browser.

### Experiment and learn:
All notebooks are independent. Feel free to run, tweak, and build on them to deepen your understanding of neural networks and PyTorch.
