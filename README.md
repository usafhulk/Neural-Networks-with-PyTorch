# Neural Networks with PyTorch: Tensors and Datasets

## Overview

Welcome to my hands-on exploration of neural networks using PyTorch! This repository is a comprehensive, project-based journey through foundational AI concepts, focusing on tensors, datasets, and various forms of linear regression. Each topic is organized into progressive, self-contained modules—delivered as interactive Jupyter notebooks—making it easy to follow, experiment, and deepen your understanding.

## Getting Started

If you want to dive in and explore these notebooks yourself:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usafhulk/Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch-Tensor-and-Datasets.git
cd Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch-Tensor-and-Datasets
```

### Set up your environment:

I recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` isn’t included, you can install the basics:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib jupyter
```

### Run the notebooks:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any notebook you want from your browser.
